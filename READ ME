📑 Excel File Format (employee_data.xlsx)
Your Excel sheet should have these columns:

Name	Email	Employee ID	Net Salary	Bank Name	Account Number

💡 If using Gmail, create an App Password from your Google account settings.

🧾 How to Run It
Make sure all required packages are installed.

Make sure .env and employee_data.xlsx are in the same folder.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python project.py
The script will:

Create payslip PDFs in the payslips/ folder

Email each employee their PDF

🛠️ Customizing the Payslip
If you want to change the look of the payslip (fonts, layout, colors), you can edit the part in the script where FPDF is used.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
pdf.set_font("Arial", "B", 16)
pdf.cell(200, 10, "Payslip", ln=True, align="C")
🧯 Error Handling
The script handles errors like:

Missing .env or Excel file

Wrong email or password

Problems sending email

All errors are printed in the terminal so you know what went wrong.

🧼 Cleaning Tips
Delete old payslips from the payslips/ folder if needed

Always double-check your .env before sharing your project
